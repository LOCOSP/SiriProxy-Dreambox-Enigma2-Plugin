This plugin let's you control a TV using Apple's Siri and a Dreambox.
You need an enigma 2 compatible dreambox.

More info on how to configure will follow soon.
For questions checkout my blog at: http://techjunkie.eu or
contact me on twitter @ninja98

to use this with siriproxy add this to your config.yml:

 - name: 'Dreambox'
      git: 'git://github.com/ninja98/SiriProxy-Dreambox-Enigma2-Plugin.git' # git works just like specifying in Gemfile
      alias_file: "<full_path>/dreambox-aliases.yml" 
      ip_dreambox: "<ip dreambox>"
      bouquet: "<name of bouquet to load>"

Run 'siriproxy bundle' to get the plugin.
The alias_file parameter is an optional parameter and lets you create a yml file with your own channel aliases.
The bouquet parameter is an optional parameter and lets limit the channels siri knows about to a particular bouquet.

fe.
BBC1: BBC1 London
BBC2: BBC2 England

Will map BBC1 speech keyword returned by siri to BBC1 London channel name on your Dreambox.
Also see the example directory for an example file you can use as a template

Some other notes:

- The first siri request to SiriProxy will trigger the plugin init and load all channels from your dreambox
  bouquets. Your first talk with siri might fail because of this. After that it's cached and it will work fine.
- set class var @@LANG in siriproxy-dreambox.rb to :ger is you want german
- Check out my video at http://www.techjunkie.eu/2011/12/control-your-tv-using-your-iphone-and-siri-by-ninja0091/ for examples how to use this plugin.
- If you run into ruby crashes with http.rb:799 install ruby like this: rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p0 --with-openssl-dir=/opt/local --with-iconv-dir=$rvm_path/usr
Have fun!
