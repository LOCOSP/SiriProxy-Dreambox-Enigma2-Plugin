This plugin let's you control a TV using Apple's Siri and a Dreambox.
You need an enigma 2 compatible dreambox.

More info on how to configure will follow soon.
For questions checkout my blog at: http://techjunkie.eu or
contact me on twitter @ninja98

to use this with siriproxy add this to your config.yml:

 - name: 'Dreambox plugin by @ninja98'
      git: 'git://github.com/SiriProxy-Dreambox-Enigma2-Plugin.git' # git works just like specifying in Gemfile
      alias_file: "<full_path>/dreambox-aliases.yml" 
      ip_dreambox: "<ip dreambox>"

Run 'siriproxy bundle' to get the plugin.
The alias file is an optional parameter and lets you create a yml file with your own channel aliases.

fe.
BBC1: BBC1 London
BBC2: BBC2 England

Will map BBC1 speech keyword returned by siri to BBC1 London channel name on your Dreambox.


Some other notes:

- The first siri request to SiriProxy will trigger the plugin init and load all channels from your dreambox
  bouquets. Your first and second talk with siri might fail because of this. After that it's cached and it will work fine.
- Check out my video at http://www.techjunkie.eu/2011/12/control-your-tv-using-your-iphone-and-siri-by-ninja0091/ for examples how to use this plugin.

Have fun!
